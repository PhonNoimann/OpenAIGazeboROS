# Simulations

01: alpha = 0.2 gamma = 0.4 (500 episodes, rewards: +2 forward, +1 turn)

02: alpha = 0.1 gamma = 0.9 (500 episodes, rewards: +2 forward, +1 turn)

03: alpha = 0.1 gamma = 0.9 (500 episodes, rewards: +2 forward, +1 turn)

04: alpha = 0.1 gamma = 0.9 (200 episodes, rewards: +2 forward, +1 turn)

05: alpha = 0.1 gamma = 0.9 (1000 episodes, rewards: +100 every 70 steps, +0.1 for every 0.4 m from side walls, +0.2 for every 0.4 m from front wall)
